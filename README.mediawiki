=About=

[https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/ Miniscript] is a language for composing Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, facilitating analysis, composition, and generic signing. It's a simplified, composable subset of Bitcoin's Script language. Developed to overcome limitations in writing complex spending conditions directly in Bitcoin Script, it enables formal verification and offers a more human-friendly interface.

# Have reviewed templates that leverage miniscript to assure there are not unintended ways of executing a valid spend beyond the intended miniscript policy.

# Have standardized usages of miniscript to streamline software and hardware wallet integrations.

# Have uniform on-chain usage of miniscript templates for better privacy.
