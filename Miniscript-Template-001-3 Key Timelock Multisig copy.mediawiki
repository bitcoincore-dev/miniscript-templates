3 Key Degrading Multisig

=Goal to be achieved by template=

The 2 of 3 Multisig has become a standard in Multisignature solutions. It offers a well-balanced mix of redundancy, security, flexibility, and practicality for securing Bitcoin. Losing one key is not disasterous, and keys can be distributed for better security.

With Miniscript, the addition of time as a security feature enables further disaster recovery such that if two keys were to be lost, a timelock can be employed to allow the wallet to become a 1 of 3 multisig. This can be employed by using a miniscript `tresh()` with four conditions:

This template is proposing 2 Conditions to be satisfied from:

<pre>
1. Key 1
2. Key 2
3. Key 3
4. timelock (either relative or absolute)
</pre>

At the wallet's inception, it would require 2 of 3 keys, as if the wallet was a normal legacy 2 of 3 multisig. After the passing of the timelock though, only one key would be required to spend the funds.
